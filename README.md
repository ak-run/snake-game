# snake-game

This is a day 20 project from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023." by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

It's a snake game built using turtle module.
My version has:
- the snake eats (or rather drinks) coffee
- it's made of circles, so it looks a bit like a caterpillar.

(both of those can be easily changed for classic look)

 So if you, like me, used to play snake on a Nokia phone, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game.
