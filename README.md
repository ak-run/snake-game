# Snake Game
A version of snake game, just like from Nokia 6110 phone. It's built using a turtle module
Some differences:
- the snake eats (or rather drinks) coffee
- it's made of circles, so it looks more like a caterpillar.

## Getting started
Most operating systems should have turtle module installed, but if not you can install it in Terminal or an IDE.

## Acknowledgments
This is a day 20 project from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023." by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.
